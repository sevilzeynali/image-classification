# Image classification by transfer learning

It is a  Python program for image classification. Complete dataset is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ikarus777/best-artworks-of-all-time?select=images). I used a sample of 4 classes available in dataset.zip.

# Important
We test this program here with a very small sample of paintings. For doing well you can download all dataset of paintings and test it.

## Installing and requirements
You need to install :

 - Python
 - Pandas
 - Matplotlib
 - Sklearn
 
## How does it work
To run this program you shoud do in a terminal or conda environment
```
paintings_classification.py
 ```
## Evaluation
This program uses EfficientNetB1 model to transfer learning. For evaluating this model we use confusion matrix.
